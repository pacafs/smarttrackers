Created a seed with both users - Editor / Manager 

To sign in with an Editor  account use -> email: editor@gmail.com  pass: password
To sign in with an Manager account use -> email: manager@gmail.com pass: password

Made a very simple UI with bootstrap where a User(editor) can log in and create a power gauge with the specified data. Then he'll be redirected to another page where he can fill in the measurement for that power gauge. 

Then another User(Manager) logs in and can view all the power gauges created as well as their measurements. 

Lastly the Manager can review the measurements with "Approved or Rejected".
In case of being Rejected, the Editor can go back and edit his measurement. If the review is set to "Approved" then both users can't perform anymore actions.

For testing(for the sake of time) I just made a very simple run through of the entire cycle of an Editor creating the power gauges adding their details and afterwards their respective measurements.
Then the Manager review it.
